# Email Marketing Sequence Application

## Overview

This application allows users to design and implement an email marketing sequence using a visual flowchart interface. The application is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and the **React Flow** library for the frontend flowchart interface. The backend utilizes **Agenda** and **Nodemailer** for scheduling and sending emails.

## Features

- **Frontend**: A flowchart interface where users can add and remove nodes for:
  - Cold Email
  - Wait/Delay
  - Lead Source
- **Backend**: A **POST** API that schedules emails using **Agenda** and sends them using **Nodemailer**.
- Emails are scheduled based on the time and delay nodes in the flowchart.
